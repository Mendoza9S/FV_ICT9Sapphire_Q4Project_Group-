    <h1>What's Next?</h1>
    <h6>
      After experiencing this school yearâ€™s set of lessons in coding, my group can do nothing but expect even harder ones next school year. 
      We expected coding to be difficult, but not only was it as such, it was also very repetitive. Hence, if we did not have a certain code 
      or if we did not attend one session of ICT, we would be really lost in class. Despite this, we do recognize that coding is an essential 
      part of our education that can open doors to other job opportunities if taken seriously. In relation to this, we not only expect but 
      also want harder coding lessons next school year to enhance our capabilities and resume in the coding department.
